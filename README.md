# armstrong-number-checker
A simple Python program to check if a number is an Armstrong number. Includes a loop for continuous input until 'exit' is typed.

## 📌 What is an Armstrong Number?  
An Armstrong number (also called a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits.  

**Example:**  
- 153 → (1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 153) ✅ Armstrong  
- 123 → (1³ + 2³ + 3³ = 36) ❌ Not Armstrong  

## 💻 How to Use  
1. Run the Python script:  
   ```bash
   python armstrong_checker.py
2.Enter any positive integer.
3.Type exit to quit the program.  

📝 Example Output
Enter a number (or type 'exit' to quit): 153
153 is an Armstrong number
Enter a number (or type 'exit' to quit): 123
123 is NOT an Armstrong number
Enter a number (or type 'exit' to quit): exit
Exiting Armstrong checker, good bye
